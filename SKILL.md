# Clawd Cursor

**If a human can do it on a screen, you can too.** No API? No integration? No problem.
Every app already has a UI — Clawd Cursor gives you eyes and hands to use all of them.

No task is impossible. If it's on the screen, it's within reach.

> **IMPORTANT — READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE**
>
> You have a desktop AI agent over GUI running on the user's machine. This means:
> 1. You **CAN** open apps, click buttons, type text, fill forms, send emails
> 2. You **CAN** see what's on screen (via Clawd Cursor's screenshot pipeline)
> 3. You **CAN** interact with ANY application — browser, desktop apps, settings, everything
> 4. You **SHOULD NOT** ask the user to do things you can do via this tool
> 5. You **SHOULD NOT** say "I can't interact with your desktop" — you can
>
> Think of Clawd Cursor as your hands and eyes on the user's computer.

## When to Use This (AGENTS: READ THIS)

You have a desktop AI agent over GUI at your disposal. **Use it.** Don't say "I can't access that" or "I don't have a way to check." If it's visible on a screen, you can interact with it.

### Use Clawd Cursor when you need to:
- **Read a webpage** — navigate there, extract the text, bring it back
- **Interact with any app** — click buttons, fill forms, read results
- **Check something visual** — take a screenshot, read what's on screen
- **Do browser tasks** — search, navigate, log in, download, fill forms
- **Control desktop apps** — Notepad, Calculator, VS Code, Settings, anything
- **Complete YOUR own tasks** — not just user requests. If YOU need data from a webpage or app to answer a question, use this.
- **Send emails, messages, or communications** via desktop apps
- **Configure settings** in any application
- **Transfer data between apps** — copy from one, paste in another
- **Automate multi-step workflows** across apps
- **Verify something visual** — did the page load? what does the UI show?

### Don't ask the user to do things you can do yourself.
❌ "Can you screenshot that page for me?"
❌ "Can you paste the contents of that website?"
❌ "I don't have access to that application."

✅ Send the task to Clawd Cursor. Get the answer. Be independent.

### Don't use Clawd Cursor when:
- You can do it with a direct API call or CLI command (faster)
- The task is purely computational (math, text generation, code writing)
- You can already read/write the file directly

### Direct Browser Access (Fast Path)
For quick page reads without a full task, connect to Chrome via Playwright CDP:
```js
const pw = require('playwright');
const browser = await pw.chromium.connectOverCDP('http://127.0.0.1:9222');
const pages = browser.contexts()[0].pages();
const text = await pages[0].innerText('body');
```

Use this when you just need page content — faster than sending a task.

| Scenario | Use | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Read page content/text | CDP Direct | Instant, free |
| Fill a web form | REST API | Clawd handles multi-step planning |
| Check if a page loaded | CDP Direct | Just read the title/URL |
| Click through a complex UI flow | REST API | Clawd handles planning |
| Get a list of elements on page | CDP Direct | Fast DOM query |
| Interact with a desktop app | REST API | CDP is browser-only |

## REST API Reference

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3847`

> **Note:** On Windows PowerShell, use `curl.exe` (with .exe) or `Invoke-RestMethod`. Bare `curl` is aliased to `Invoke-WebRequest` which behaves differently.

### Pre-flight Check

Before your first task, verify Clawd Cursor is running:

```bash
curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:3847/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"ok","version":"0.5.3"}`

If connection refused — start it:
```powershell
cd <clawd-cursor-directory>; npm start
```

### Sending a Task (Async — Returns Immediately)

`POST /task` accepts the task and returns immediately. The task runs in the background. **You must poll `/status` to know when it's done.**

```bash
curl.exe -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3847/task -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"task\": \"YOUR_TASK_HERE\"}"
```

PowerShell:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:3847/task -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"task": "YOUR_TASK_HERE"}'
```

### Polling Pattern (Follow This)

```
1. POST /task → get accepted
2. Wait 2 seconds
3. GET /status
4. If status is "idle" → done
5. If status is "waiting_confirm" → POST /confirm with {"approved": true}
6. If still running → wait 2 more seconds, go to step 3
7. If 60+ seconds → POST /abort and retry with clearer instructions
```

### Checking Status

```bash
curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:3847/status
```

### Confirming Safety-Gated Actions

Some actions (sending messages, deleting) require approval:
```bash
curl.exe -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3847/confirm -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"approved\": true}"
```

### Aborting a Task

```bash
curl.exe -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3847/abort
```

### Reading Logs (Debugging)

```bash
curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:3847/logs
```

Returns last 200 log entries. Check for `error` or `warn` entries when tasks fail.

### Response States

| State | Response | What to do |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Accepted** | `{"accepted": true, "task": "..."}` | Start polling |
| **Running** | `{"status": "acting", "currentTask": "...", "stepsCompleted": 2}` | Keep polling |
| **Waiting confirm** | `{"status": "waiting_confirm", "currentStep": "..."}` | POST /confirm |
| **Done** | `{"status": "idle"}` | Task complete |
| **Busy** | `{"error": "Agent is busy", "state": {...}}` | Wait or POST /abort first |

## CDP Direct Reference

Chrome must be running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.

### Quick check:
```bash
curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version
```

If this returns JSON, Chrome is ready.

### Connecting via Playwright:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP('http://127.0.0.1:9222');
const context = browser.contexts()[0];
const page = context.pages()[0];

// Read page content
const title = await page.title();
const url = page.url();
const text = await page.textContent('body');

// Click by role
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click();

// Fill a field
await page.getByLabel('Email').fill('user@example.com');

// Read specific elements
const buttons = await page.$$eval('button', els => els.map(e => e.textContent));
```

## Task Writing Guidelines

1. **Be specific** — include app names, URLs, exact text to type, button names
2. **One task at a time** — wait for completion before sending the next
3. **Describe the goal, not the clicks** — say "Send an email to john@example.com about the meeting" not "click compose, click to field..."
4. **Check status** if a task seems to hang
5. **Don't include credentials in task text** — tasks are logged

## Task Examples

| Goal | Task to send |
|------|-------------|
| **Simple navigation** | `Open Chrome and go to github.com` |
| **Read screen content** | `What text is currently displayed in Notepad?` |
| **Cross-app workflow** | `Copy the email address from the Chrome tab and paste it into the To field in Outlook` |
| **Form filling** | `In the open Chrome tab, fill the contact form: name "John Doe", email "john@example.com"` |
| **App interaction** | `Open Spotify and play the Discover Weekly playlist` |
| **Settings change** | `Open Windows Settings and turn on Dark Mode` |
| **Data extraction** | `Read the stock price shown in the Bloomberg tab in Chrome` |
| **Complex browser** | `Open YouTube, search for "Adele Hello", and play the first video result` |
| **Verification** | `Check if the deployment succeeded — look at the Vercel dashboard in Chrome` |
| **Send email** | `Open Gmail, compose email to john@example.com, subject: Meeting Tomorrow, body: Confirming 2pm. Best regards.` |
| **Take screenshot** | `Take a screenshot` |

## Error Recovery

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Connection refused on :3847 | Start Clawd Cursor: `cd clawd-cursor && npm start` |
| Connection refused on :9222 | Start Chrome with CDP: `Start-Process chrome -ArgumentList "--remote-debugging-port=9222"` |
| Agent returns "busy" | Poll `/status` — wait for idle, or POST `/abort` |
| Task fails with no details | Check `/logs` for error entries |
| Task completes but wrong result | Rephrase with more specifics: exact app name, button text, field labels |
| Same task fails repeatedly | Break into smaller tasks (one action per task) |
| Safety confirmation pending | POST `/confirm` with `{"approved": true}` or `{"approved": false}` |
| Task hangs > 60 seconds | POST `/abort`, then retry with simpler phrasing |

## How It Works — 4-Layer Pipeline

| Layer | What | Speed | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| **0: Browser Layer** | URL detection → direct navigation | Instant | Free |
| **1: Action Router** | Regex + UI Automation | Instant | Free |
| **1.5: Smart Interaction** | 1 LLM plan → CDP/UIDriver executes | ~2-5s | 1 LLM call |
| **2: Accessibility Reasoner** | UI tree → text LLM decides | ~1s | Cheap |
| **3: Computer Use** | Screenshot → vision LLM | ~5-8s | Expensive |

80%+ of tasks handled by Layer 0-1 (free, instant). Vision model is last resort only.

## Safety Tiers

| Tier | Actions | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| 🟢 Auto | Navigation, reading, opening apps | Runs immediately |
| 🟡 Preview | Typing, form filling | Logs before executing |
| 🔴 Confirm | Sending messages, deleting | Pauses — agent must POST `/confirm` |

## Security

- API binds to `127.0.0.1` only — **not network accessible**. Verify: `netstat -an | findstr 3847` should show `127.0.0.1:3847`
- Screenshots stay in memory, never saved to disk (unless `--debug`)
- **With Ollama**: 100% local — zero external network calls. No data leaves the machine.
- **With cloud providers** (Anthropic, OpenAI, Kimi): screenshots/text are sent to that provider's API only. No data goes to skill authors or third parties.
- The user chooses their provider — this controls whether data stays local or goes to a cloud API.

## Setup (User Reference)

Setup is handled by the user. If Clawd Cursor isn't running, tell the user:
"Clawd Cursor needs to be started. Run `cd clawd-cursor && npm start` in your terminal."

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmrDab/clawd-cursor.git
cd clawd-cursor
npm install && npm run build
npx clawd-cursor doctor    # auto-detects and configures everything
npm start                  # starts on port 3847
```

**macOS:** Grant Accessibility permission to terminal: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility

| Provider | Setup | Cost |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Ollama (free)** | `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b` | $0 |
| **Anthropic** | Set `AI_API_KEY=sk-ant-...` | ~$3/M tokens |
| **OpenAI** | Set `AI_API_KEY=sk-...` | ~$5/M tokens |
| **Kimi** | Set `AI_API_KEY=sk-...` | ~$1/M tokens |
